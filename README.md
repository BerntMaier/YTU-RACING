# YTU-RACING/STEP-UP PCB
Hello everyone! In this article, we will talk about the Step-up PCB we designed for our electric vehicle YTR08E by YTU Racing in the Formula Student competition, the world's most prestigious undergraduate engineering competition, attended by university students from all over the world who are interested in motor racing

** About the Step Up PCB;**

A voltage booster circuit was needed to feed the other circuits we designed with 24 V. Because our battery can give a max of 16.8 V. We tried to keep the PCB as small as possible, as the PCB will fit into a very narrow space. Since the screw hole is needed, we put a small piece of screw hole at the bottom of the PCB. We produced it by the datasheet of the regulator we use. We replaced the R2 and R1 resistors with a manually adjustable Trimpot. All of the components we used were selected to withstand a minimum of 50V 6 amps.

This design is sponsored by JLCPCB. After designing the circuit however you want, you can order your PCB and get it to your hand in a short time! We would like to thank JLCPCB for their support and we are very satisfied with the service we received. First, you have to export GERBER and NC files of your PCB files. JLCPCB explained how to do it you can visit the website. They communicate very quickly in the format of the PCB Gerber file or in case determination that may cause any problems in terms of production and they deliver the PCB without any problems. After that put the files into a single RAR file then get to the order page You are even able to change PCB color for free. You can change the shipping method. JLCPCB ensures the delivery of PCB to your hand for 3 days! You can check the website of JLCPCB. We want to thank again to JLCPCB for the great quality of its service.

JLCPCB SMT Parts Library has 200k+ in-stock components (689 Basic components and 200k+ Extended components)

You can build your library Inventory, save parts for now or in the future Assembly which will be supported with 10M+ parts by Digikey, mouser, This benefits customers to source components much faster and easier, bringing you a shorter PCBA production time You can Get PCBA products in one week, from ordering, parts sourcing and PCBA prototyping Your PCBs are passing JLCPCB’s special tests such as inspection in JLCPCB’s high-tech facility and visual tests, X-ray test is used to check the quality of the solder joints (such as BGA) under the components on the line to ensure that the circuit board can achieve 100% test coverage, solder paste inspections, SPI which is checking in advance whether there is a lack of poor solder paste printing, AOI, the surface of the object can be checked correctly (but for objects hidden under the part or on the edge of the part) The solder joints may be out of reach) You can get your PCB soldered in many different ways such as hand-soldering, reﬂow soldering, and wave soldering. Your PCBs are produced on a first-class production line adopted with an advanced Yamaha automatic placement machine all those machines are equipped electric feeder, a 10 temperature zone lead-free reflow soldering, automatic printing machine. SMT production line has functioned such as sorting, rectification, cleaning, literacy, and production line discipline management.

Thank you, JLCPCB!
